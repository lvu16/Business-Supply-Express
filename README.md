Building GUI that have functionalities of the stored procedures in the database

to run the project:

- add a file named .env and fill it out using the .env.example
- run the database schema in MySQL
- run the stored procedures in MySQL
- run main.py

We built our app using HTML, CSS, and the Python framework, Flask. We used MySQL as our DBMS and for our database development and testing, we used MySQL Workbench. 


We distributed work equally amongst our team, with each of us implementing the GUI for the stored procedures and views of different entitites in our schema.
